# thesis-latex-manc-coursematerials
These are the course notes to go with thesis-latex-manc.

They were transcribed and adapted from original material produced by Tom Bishop in 2014 and 2015, when the course ran at the University of Southampton, by Tom Bishop and Gerard Capes, in 2016.

They are usually compiled using pdfTeX; the only auxiliary file required is the University of Manchester logo, of which a copy is included in this repository. 

All of the materials here (excluded the University of Manchester logo) are licenced under CC-BY-SA v4.0; see: https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/ for more details.
