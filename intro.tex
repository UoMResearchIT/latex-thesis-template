\section{The University Thesis Document}
This document is adapted from the template provided by the School of Mathematics, University of Manchester (last updated 13\textsuperscript{th} August, 2013). It was merged with another document, originally provided by Electronics \& Computer Science at the University of Southampton, but was extensively modified by a number of postgraduates in Geography \& Environment at the University of Southampton through the years. These folks include Chris Hackney, followed by Tom Bishop and Robin Wilson. Gerard Capes and Tom Bishop produced this version of the template in 2016.

\section{How to Use This Document}
Keep a copy of this in its original form for reference --- we have tried to include a few key examples of code from our own theses. Otherwise, simply modify as appropriate.

\section{Structure}
The thesis style sheet tells \LaTeX \ how to produce the output. The thesis document is where you define the variables, for example the title, your name and the chapters. The individual chapters are usually separate files (although you may combine and split them as you see fit), and images are stored as individual files. You can modify where you store these in the thesis document. Remember that paths can be relative or absolute --- relative paths are always relative to the location of the thesis document. This is recommended as it makes everything rather more portable.
