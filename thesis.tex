% It's best to use biber, not bibtex, but you'll need to modify the LateX to PDF profile in TeXnicCenter as follows:
% Change the "Path to BibTeX" executable, to the biber executable, located in the same directory
% If you don't you'll need to use "backend=bibtex8" as an option e.g. \usepackage[backend=bibtex8]{biblatex}

% This is a big old kludge to get APA formatting to work.
% Although it'll save you headache in the long-run, it does seem a bit of a pain to add all this overhead for what should be a defined profile native to biblatex.

\beforeabstract
Write your abstract here: Remember, it must fit on this A4 page and should describe contents of the thesis/dissertation. Here might also be a good place to indicate what you have achieved in the thesis/dissertation and, in the case of a PhD, what new results you have discovered. Note that for a PhD single-spacing is used throughout the abstract, including displayed equations \[e = mc^{2}\] as for the above example.
