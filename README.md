# thesis-latex-manc
This is a template for typesetting theses at the University of Manchester.

This document is adapted from the template provided by the School of Mathematics, University of Manchester (last updated 13th August, 2013). It was merged with another document, originally provided by Electronics & Computer Science at the University of Southampton, but was extensively modified by a number of postgraduates in Geography & Environment at the University of Southampton through the years. These folks include Chris Hackney, followed by Tom Bishop and Robin Wilson. Gerard Capes and Tom Bishop produced this version of the template in 2016.

This document has been tested to compile correctly using LuaLaTeX to PDF with biber as the backend for biblatex.
