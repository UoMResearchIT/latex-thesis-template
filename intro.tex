\section{The University Thesis Document}
This document was originally served from the University of Southampton ECS pages. It has since been modified by a number of postgraduates in Geography \& Environment through the years. These folks include Chris Hackney, followed by Tom Bishop and Robin Wilson. Tom Bishop and Robin Wilson compiled the various modifications and example code into this document.

\section{How to Use This Document}
Keep a copy of this in its original form for reference --- we have tried to include a few key examples of code from our own theses. Otherwise, simply modify as appropriate.

\section{Structure}
The thesis style sheet tells \LaTeX \ how to produce the output. The thesis document is where you define the variables, for example the title, your name and the chapters. The individual chapters are usually separate files (although you may combine and split them as you see fit), and images are stored as individual files. You can modify where you store these in the thesis document. Remember that paths can be relative or absolute --- relative paths are always relative to the location of the thesis document. This is recommended as it makes everything rather more portable.
